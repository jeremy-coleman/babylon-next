### Installation & Use

This is a platform-agnostic monorepository minimum setup boilerplate.

It has been tested and works with Node.js v12.22.1.

The setup uses [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) to easily scale to different clients (React Native for iOS, Android, Electron) or server (Node.js).

This way, you can maximize code reuse between platforms to enforce **best programming practices**.
